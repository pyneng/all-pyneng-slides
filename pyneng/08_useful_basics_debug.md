### Debug

Classic advice about this, by Brian Kernighan: “Debugging is twice as hard as
writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as
cleverly as you can, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”
This is part of why “clever” is not a positive word when used to describe
Python code, or a coder...
